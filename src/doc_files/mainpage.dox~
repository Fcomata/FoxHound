DataStructures4Beamer is a library created for any help learning how abstract data structure, the library is basically provide the methods necessary for the developer to create and manage data structures, plus it generates a pdf file based on the structure data that is being used, the file shows each phase the structure is subjected.

Caveats aside, you might get started learning about abstract data structures reading the recommended lectures , those are located in Related Pages.

There are several other places to look for D-Bus information, such as the tutorial and the specification; those can be found at the D-Bus website. If you're interested in a sysadmin or package maintainer's perspective on the dbus-daemon itself and its configuration, be sure to check out the man pages as well.

The low-level API documented in this manual deliberately lacks most convenience functions - those are left up to higher-level libraries based on frameworks such as GLib, Qt, Python, Mono, Java, etc. These higher-level libraries (often called "D-Bus bindings") have features such as object systems and main loops that allow a much more convenient API.

The low-level API also contains plenty of clutter to support integration with arbitrary object systems, languages, main loops, and so forth. These features add a lot of noise to the API that you probably don't care about unless you're coding a binding.

This manual also contains docs for D-Bus internals, so you can use it to get oriented to the D-Bus source code if you're interested in patching the code. You should also read the file HACKING which comes with the source code if you plan to contribute to D-Bus.

As you read the code, you can identify internal D-Bus functions because they start with an underscore ('_') character. Also, any identifier or macro that lacks a DBus, dbus_, or DBUS_ namepace prefix is internal, with a couple of exceptions such as NULL, TRUE, and FALSE.
